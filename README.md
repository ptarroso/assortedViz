# assortedViz

The package *assortedViz* is a collection of plotting functions. It wasn't meant
to be a package but it seems more useful. It is more organized, user-friendly,
allows to associate help with the functions, and easy to install. Currently, it
offers a single plot type, but I plan to add more in the future.

If you have any idea or code you want to contribute use some of the github
magic (issues, cloning, patches, etc). Meanwhile, I hope it is useful!

## Installation

There are several option to install *assortedViz*:

- To install the current released version found [here](), you need to
  download the built *tar.gz* package file and install it.

- Clone the repository with *git* and build the package in your computer.

- Use the *devtools* package in R. Example code:

```
    library(devtools)
    install_github("ptarroso/assortedViz", subdir="source")
```
